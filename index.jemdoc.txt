I am a PhD student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich, advised by [https://odi.inf.ethz.ch/niaohe Niao He]. I also work closely with [https://sites.google.com/site/negarkiyavash/ Negar Kiyavash]. My research interest lies in optimization and its applications in machine learning. Before that, I received master's degree in Industrial Engineering from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I received bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics from UCLA in 2017.
